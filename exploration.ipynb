With 66 million parameters, the [distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) model by Hugging Face maintains around 97% of BERT's performance while being significantly faster and lighter. Fine-tuned on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset, it achieves 91.3% accuracy in sentiment classification, close to BERT's 92.7%. The model performs binary sentiment classification, identifying text as either positive or negative."
